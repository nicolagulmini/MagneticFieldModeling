# Magnetic Field Interpolation through Gaussian Process Regression

Python implementation of an algorithm to model and interpolate the magnetic field. The objective is to apply it on the EMT system developed by [Biomedical Design Laboratory](https://biodesignucc.ie/build/html/index.html) ([University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/), Ireland) to mitigate the distortions. The challenge is to obtain good real time performances.
