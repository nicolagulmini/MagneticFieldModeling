# dataset processing
# take the data
# shuffle them
# produce training and validation set
# test on a diagonal (need to know the dimension of the cube)
# otherwise produce a test from the same dataset of the training and the validation

# gaussian process
# find the best parameters

# radial basis function interpolation
# find the best parameters

# neural netork

# once we have all of them, compare them 
# nMAE and nRMSE on validation and test
# time (?)
# uncertainty
# correlation between uncertainty and error (only for RBFI and GP)
